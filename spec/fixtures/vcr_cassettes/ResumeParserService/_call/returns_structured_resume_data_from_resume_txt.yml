        to a picturesque mountain town in Colorado, my journey with technology has
        been a blend of diverse experiences and a profound interest in continual learning.
        I''m Mel Langhoff — a backend web developer, project manager, linguist, and
        life-long student.\n\nMy career began in technology project management and
        IT consulting, where I mastered Agile methodologies, cloud migration, and
        SAP systems through roles at Xcel Energy, Sling TV, Crocs, and Sovos Compliance.
        Each project presented unique challenges and opportunities to innovate.\n\nMy
        passion for languages and teaching has been a constant thread. Fluent in Spanish,
        my experience teaching English in Barcelona enriched my communication and
        empathy skills. These lessons — patience, clarity, and a love for learning
        — fuel my approach to coding and collaboration.\n\nTransitioning to backend
        development at Turing School of Software \u0026 Design was natural. I''ve
        harnessed my technical skills and project management expertise to build robust,
        user-centric applications that bridge technology and user needs.\n\nOutside
        of work, I’m an avid cyclist and skateboarder, a food and cooking enthusiast,
        and a lover of literature and languages. These hobbies inspire creativity
        and perseverance — qualities I bring into every project. My journey exemplifies
        the power of diverse experiences and lifelong growth, and I remain committed
        to leveraging my skills to make meaningful impact in tech and beyond.\n\n---\n\n##

        a picturesque mountain town in Colorado, my journey with technology has been
        a blend of diverse experiences and profound interest in continually learning.
        I''m Mel Langhoff, a backend web developer, project manager, linguist, and
        life-long student.\n\nGrowing up in a world full of flavors and cultures,
        I found my path through a myriad of professions, each one shaping my approach
        to problem-solving and creativity. My career began in the realm of technology,
        where I dove into project management and IT consulting. My roles at Xcel Energy,
        Sling TV, Crocs, and Sovos Compliance allowed me to master Agile methodologies,
        cloud migration, and SAP systems. Each project was a puzzle, each challenge
        an opportunity to innovate and excel.\n\nMy passion for languages and teaching
        has been a constant thread through my life. Fluent in Spanish, I''ve not only
        navigated the complexities of international projects but also immersed myself
        in cultural exchanges. My time as an English teacher in Barcelona enriched
        my understanding of communication and empathy. The lessons learned from teaching
        -- patience, clarity, and a love for learning -- fuel my approach to coding
        and collaboration.\n\nThe transition to backend development was a natural
        evolution. At Turing School of Software \u0026 Design, I''ve harnessed my
        technical skills and project management expertise to build robust, user-centric
        applications. My projects showcase my commitment to creating functional, impactful
        solutions that bridge the gap between technology and user needs.\n\nOutside
        of my professional life, I''m an avid cyclist and skateboarder, a food and
        cooking enthusiast, and a lover of literature and langauges. No matter what
        I am doing, I am always learning -- whether it''s exploring new recipes, cycling
        down a country road, skating at the park, diving into the intricacies of linguistics,
        or losing myself in a good book, these hobbies keep me grounded and inspired.
        They remind me that creativity and problem-solving extend beyond the digital
        world and into every aspect of life. Through dedication to my hobbies, I have
        been able to have the perserverence to improve my abilities and strengthen
        myself by setting new goals and working to achieve new things.\n\nMy journey
        is a testament to the power of diverse experiences and the pursuit of continuous
        growth. Each chapter, from managing complex IT projects to crafting code,
        has equipped me with a unique perspective and a passion for innovation. As
        I continue to evolve in the tech world, I remain committed to leveraging my
        skills and experiences to make a meaningful impact.\n\n\n\nLife-long learner,
        passionate teacher, and data-driven software developer committed to creative
        thinking and outside-the-box solutions. Fluent in Spanish, drawing from a
        background in IT project management, and with a deep appreciation for cultural
        exchange, I use my diverse experiences to create impactful and resonant results.\n\nhttps://github.com/mel-langhoff/battleship\nhttps://github.com/mel-langhoff/market_money\nhttps://github.com/mel-langhoff/resume\nhttps://www.mel-langhoff.com\n\nXcel
